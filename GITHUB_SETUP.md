## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

Open terminal in the `SkillSync` folder:

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd "E:\Projects\Project 1\SkillSync"

# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: SkillSync - AI Career Path Recommendation System"
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**
   - Visit [github.com](https://github.com)
   - Click the "+" icon → "New repository"

2. **Configure Repository**
   ```
   Repository name: SkillSync
   Description: AI-Powered Career Path Recommendation & Learning Tracker
   Visibility: Public (or Private)
   
   ❌ Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
   ❌ Don't add .gitignore (we already have one)
   ❌ Don't add license yet
   ```

3. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 3: Connect and Push

GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add remote repository (replace YOUR-USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/SkillSync.git

## 🌿 Branching Strategy

### Create Development Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to dev branch
git checkout -b development

# Push dev branch
git push -u origin development
```

### Recommended Branches

```
main          → Production-ready code
development   → Development branch
feature/*     → New features
bugfix/*      → Bug fixes
hotfix/*      → Urgent production fixes
```

---

## 🔒 Protect Sensitive Data

### Before Pushing - Verify .gitignore

Make sure these files are **NOT** committed:

```
❌ application.properties (with real API keys)
❌ .env files with secrets
❌ node_modules/
❌ target/
❌ .idea/
❌ *.class files
```

### Check What Will Be Committed

```bash
# See what will be committed
git status

# See all tracked files
git ls-files
```

### Remove Sensitive Files (if accidentally committed)

```bash
# Remove from git (keeps local copy)
git rm --cached backend/src/main/resources/application.properties

# Add to .gitignore
echo "application.properties" >> backend/.gitignore

# Commit the change
git commit -m "Remove sensitive configuration file"
```
